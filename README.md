# ICD-10 Expansion for CL/P

This repository stores the data dictionary (codebook) describing an ICD-10-CM-based expanded code set that allows accurate phenotypic description of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P). The expanded codes are collapsible into the official parent ICD-10-CM codes. Where possible, a crosswalk is provided to facilitate conversion of the expanded codes into alternate coding schemes (e.g., CDC-BPA, ICD-9-CM, SNOMED-CT).

Use of this ICD-10 Expansion for CL/P is explained in the following publication:

`Allori AC, Cragan JD, Cassell CH, and Marcus JR. An ICD-10-based expanded code set for use in cleft lip/palate research and surveillance.  *Birth Defects Res Part A*. ACCEPTED, PENDING PUBLICATION.`
